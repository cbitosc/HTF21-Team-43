        <p>Weather is the mix of events that happen each day in our atmosphere. Weather is different in different parts of the world and changes over minutes, hours, days and weeks. Most weather happens in the troposphere, the part of Earthâ€™s atmosphere that is closest to the ground.</p>
        <p>This application is an effort to provide the user about the weather information in his/her current location. So that user can schedule their work accordingly.</p>
        <p>Meteorologists develop local or regional weather forecasts including predictions for several days into the future. The best forecasts take into account the weather events that are happening over a broad region. Knowing where storms are now can help forecasters predict where storms will be tomorrow and the next day. Technology, such as weather satellites and Doppler radar, helps the process of looking over a large area, as does the network of weather observations.

        The chaotic nature of the atmosphere means that it will probably always be impossible to predict the weather more than two weeks ahead; however, new technologies combined with more traditional methods are allowing forecasters to develop better and more complete forecasts.</p>
